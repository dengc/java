## Color  Theory
-------------------------------------
### Frequency
- Red to Purple : f -> low to high
- Wavelength * f = v
- different spectrum can be same perceived color C

### Projector
- P(primaries) = 3 light sources, associated with M
- M {m1, m2, m3} = filters, generate channels
- a {a1, a2, a3} = channels
- g = generated spectrum

#### Different Filters
- RGB -> associated with primaries
- XYZ -> CIE
